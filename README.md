# Breast Cancer Prediction

## what is Breast cancer?
Acorrdin to WikiPedia, Breast cancer classification divides breast cancer into categories according to different schemes criteria and serving a different purpose. The major categories are the histopathological type, the grade of the tumor, the stage of the tumor, and the expression of proteins and genes. As knowledge of cancer cell biology develops these classifications are updated.

- Histopathology.
- Grade.
- Stage.
- Stages 1â€“3 are within the breast or regional lymph nodes.
- Stage 4 is a metastatic cancer.
- Receptor status.
- DNA-based classification.


## Problem Statement
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women, accounting for nearly 1 in 3 cancers diagnosed among women in the United States, and it is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. Breast Cancer occurs as a result of abnormal growth of cells in the breast tissue, commonly referred to as a Tumor. A tumor does not mean cancer - tumors can be benign (not cancerous), pre-malignant (pre-cancerous), or malignant (cancerous). Tests such as MRI, mammogram, ultrasound, and biopsy are commonly used to diagnose breast cancer performed.


Given breast cancer results from breast fine-needle aspiration (FNA) test (is a quick and simple procedure to perform, which removes some fluid or cells from a breast lesion or cyst (a lump, sore, or swelling) with a fine needle similar to a blood sample needle). Since this build a model that can classify a breast cancer tumor using two training classification:

- 1 = Malignant (Cancerous) - Present
- 0 = Benign (Not Cancerous) -Absent


## Data Set Information:
<font color='green'>
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found at [Web Link]

Separating plane described above was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, "Decision Tree Construction Via Linear Programming." Proceedings of the 4th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society, pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree. Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes.

The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane in the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
