    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women, accounting for nearly 1 in 3 cancers diagnosed among women in the United States, and it is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. Breast Cancer occurs as a result of abnormal growth of cells in the breast tissue, commonly referred to as a Tumor. A tumor does not mean cancer - tumors can be benign (not cancerous), pre-malignant (pre-cancerous), or malignant (cancerous). Tests such as MRI, mammogram, ultrasound, and biopsy are commonly used to diagnose breast cancer performed."

Since this build a model that can classify a breast cancer tumor using two training classification:\n",

    "Since the labels in the data are discrete, the predication falls into two categories, (i.e. Malignant or benign). In machine learning, this is a classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Thus, the goal is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant and predict the recurrence and non-recurrence of malignant cases after a certain period. To achieve this we have used machine learning classification methods to fit a function that can predict the discrete class of new input."
